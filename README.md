# JOINT PROJECT - TRAININGWELL
Joint project from the Major in Software Engineering, Degree in Computer Engineering, in University of Lleida, Spain

# THE PROJECT
The TRAININGWELL company owns a sports complex in the city of Lleida with several sports facilities, which can be used to 
hold events between friends and also competitions between organisations. In order to achieve that, these facilities can be 
reserved by an event organizer who will be responsible of making the reservation under his or her name and making the payment.
<br>
The system to be created will be a single web platform available in different devices like computers, mobile phones, tablets, 
among others, and it will provide all the necessary services to event organizers, the facilities responsible, the complex manager 
and participants or observers, in order to satisfy their needs effectively.
